		<h1> Beef and Cabbage Stew</h1>

		<h2>Description </h2>
			<p>
			This beef and cabbage stew is a very good recipe. My 93-year-old mother-in-law has recently told me that this is the best meal I have ever brought her, and there have been many. All the veggie prep can be done while the onions and bay leaves are simmering. I do add more broth when the veggies go in. The cabbage will add a significant amount of water but the beef flavor is key. It will freeze great in resealable bags for a quick meal so I normally double the recipe when going to this effort, which in my opinion is well worth it. The 2-hour simmering step for the beef can be done the day before.
